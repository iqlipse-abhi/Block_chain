## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --contract --template hardhat-javascript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `contracts/Contract.sol`.

To add functionality to your contracts, you can use the `@thirdweb-dev/contracts` package which provides base contracts and extensions to inherit. The package is already installed with this project. Head to our [Contracts Extensions Docs](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit) to learn more.

## Building the project

After any changes to the contract, run:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

to compile your contracts. This will also detect the [Contracts Extensions Docs](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit) detected on your contract.

## Deploying Contracts

When you're ready to deploy your contracts, just run one of the following command to deploy you're contracts:

```bash
npm run deploy
# or
yarn deploy
```

## Releasing Contracts

If you want to release a version of your contracts publicly, you can use one of the followings command:

```bash
npm run release
# or
yarn release
```

## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template vite-javascript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/main.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `src/index.jsx`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app,
this is necessary for our [hooks](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react) and
[UI Components](https://portal.thirdweb.com/ui-components) to work.

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add environment variables. Check the `.env.example` file for all the environment variables required and add it to `.env.local` file or set them up on your hosting provider.
